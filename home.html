            <p>For years, women have been oppressed and silenced, unable to use their voices to speak their truth. </p>
            <p>Though women have gained many basic human rights over multiple centuries,  stories from women and girls all across the world are still kept hidden.  </p>
            <p>How can we say that there is equality in the world when many women still face the threat of physical violence every single day?</p>

            <p>"She Means No" aims to educate and spread awareness on the topic of assault particularly towards women and girls. </p>
            <p>Our mission is to disseminate facts and empower victims of assault who are too afraid to come out with their testimonies.  </p>
            <p>When she says no, she means NO!</p>
